                    Hello, welcome to my personal website!

                    <br><br>
                    I am a strong-willed aspiring Software Developer interested in retail and fintech, with strengths in critical thinking, planning, and leadership. My preferred programming languages are Java and C++.

                    <br><br>
                    Back when I locked myself away from the world, I was introduced to programming while contributing to video game websites built with MediaWiki. When I was granted the responsibility of an administrator, I taught myself web coding fundamentals, and produced satisfactory results. Upon the realization of my ability, I pursued a formal education in Computer Science in hopes of making up all the years I've lost to depression.

                    <br><br>
                    I had a very rocky start in college; but thanks to the encouragement and the second chance that my professors and counselors at CSI gave me, I fought against my weaknesses, beat the odds, and redeemed myself, graduating magna sum laude for my Associate's Degree and getting accepted into the competitive CUNY Tech Prep program!

                <p>
                    My interests lie in software development, time management, organizational psychology, social psychology, and game development. I enjoy observing the stock market, planning my personal schedule, self-reflection, baking, gaming, gardening, fish-keeping, and photography in my free time.
